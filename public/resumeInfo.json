    "description": "Hello! My name is Roger Reyes and I am a software developer. Prior to this I was enlisted in the US Army for 7 years and I worked in Satellite Communications. A majority of that time was spent in Okinawa, Japan where I worked on large scale operations supporting all branches across the Pacific. In Okinawa I also served as the Vice President of Better Opportunities where we led community events to strengthen our bonds with Japanese locals and improved team morale and cohesion. After finishing my contract with the military I decided to pursue software development starting in college which later transitioned to attending the Java development course at Code Fellows. As I progress in my career I look forward to working on new and challenging ideas, delving deeper and deeper into the vast coding world!",
